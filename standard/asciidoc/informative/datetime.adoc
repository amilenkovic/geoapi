==== Date and time
[.reference]_From ISO 19103:2015 §7.2.2 to 7.2.4_

The ISO 19103 `Date` interface gives values for year, month and day
while the `Time` interface gives values for hour, minute and second.
`DateTime` is the combination of a date with a time, with or without timezone.
GeoAPI maps the ISO date and time interfaces to the types provided in the standard library of target languages.
In some cases like Java, this mapping forces GeoAPI to choose whether the time component shall include timezone
information or not since the choices are represented by different types
(e.g. `LocalDateTime`, `OffsetDateTime` and `ZonedDateTime`).
The timezone information is often desired for geospatial data
(for example in the acquisition time of a remote sensing image),
but may be undesired for some other cases like office opening hours.
In the later case, the decision to include timezone or not depends if the opening hours apply to one specific office
or to all offices spanning the multiple timezones of a country.
GeoAPI generally includes timezone information, but this policy may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis.

[small]#(1) Some properties defined in GeoAPI 3._x_ use the legacy `java.util.Date` class for historical reasons.# +

*Note:* `DateTime` is distinct from `Instant`.
The former is expressed in the proleptic Gregorian calendar as described in ISO 8601,
while the later is an instantaneous point on the selected time scale, astronomical or atomic.
An `Instant` does not have year, month or day components
(it is instead a duration elapsed since an epoch),
and its conversion to a `DateTime` may be complicated.
In GeoAPI, temporal objects in metadata are typically `DateTime`
while coordinates in a temporal coordinate reference system are typically `Instant`.
