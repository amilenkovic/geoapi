=== General mapping rules

This section gives high-level guidance in the mapping from UML to {supported-languages} API applying to all GeoAPI types.
Other sections after this one will focus on specific type subsets (metadata, referencing, _etc_).
Those guidance are not strict rules; departures exist on a case-by-case basis when the semantic justify them.
