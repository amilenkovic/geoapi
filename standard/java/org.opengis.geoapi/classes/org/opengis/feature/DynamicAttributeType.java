/**
 * Definition of a dynamic attribute in a moving feature type.
 * Dynamic attributes describe attributes of a feature in which the values vary with time and/or location.
 * A {@link Feature} having dynamic attributes is a moving feature.
 * A moving feature can have an arbitrary amount of time-varying attributes,
 * such as the velocity of vehicles or the wind speed of hurricanes.
 *
 * <p>Dynamic attributes are used for non-spatial attribute.
 * If the value type of a dynamic attribute is geometric point, it is a trajectory.</p>
 *
 * @param <V> the type of attribute values.
