/**
 * An instance of an {@link AttributeType} containing the value of an attribute in a feature.
 * {@code Attribute} holds three main information:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@linkplain #getType() reference to an attribute type}
 *       which defines the base Java type and domain of valid values.</li>
 *   <li>One or more {@linkplain #getValues() values}, which may be a singleton ([0 … 1] multiplicity)
 *       or multi-valued ([0 … ∞] multiplicity).</li>
 *   <li>Optional {@linkplain #characteristics() characteristics} about the attribute
 *       (e.g. a <var>temperature</var> attribute may have a characteristic holding the measurement <var>accuracy</var>).
 *       Characteristics are often, but not necessarily, constant for all attributes of the same type in a dataset.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Analogy with Java language</b><br>
 * an attribute is similar to a "field" in a Java object. A field also brings together a field name, value and type,
 * optionally completed by annotations. The value types are typically {@link String}, {@link Number} or collections
 * of them, but other Java type are allowed except {@link Feature}.
 * For storing a {@code Feature} value, use {@link FeatureAssociation} instead.
 * </div>
 *
 * <p>{@code Attribute} can be instantiated by calls to {@link AttributeType#newInstance()}.</p>
 *
 * @param <V> the type of attribute values.
